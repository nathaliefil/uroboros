Quick Guide
=====================

Welcome to Quick Guide, the easiest way to start with Uroboros.

---

# **Let's Go**

Run gui application. When it is opened, you have to select one directory from your drive. It is necessary, because Uroboros actions are 
based on manipulating files and directory from selected location. You can select location by the top right button.

When location is selected, everything is ready.

# **First Code**

```
print "hello world";
```

Try to run this code. This is Print, the basic command. It can print anything in log - texts, lists, numbers, time.

```
"hello world";
```

Print is default command and you can omit first keyword, however it is recommended to keep it for greater readability. Two first codes
make the same result.

```
print 2+2*2;
```

Print can be used to print numbers and operations on them (+,-,*,/,%).

```
print "2+2*2 = " + 2+2*2;
```

Text and numbers can be merged by the use of pluses.
